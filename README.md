Spot the Fake — A Disinformation Game

Spot the Fake is an interactive choose-your-own-path game designed to teach players how to recognize and respond to disinformation online. Built with Twine, the game simulates real-world social media scenarios, testing your ability to verify information, use fact-checking tools, and make smart decisions under pressure.

**Purpose**

Disinformation is everywhere — from fake headlines and AI-generated images to viral TikToks and misleading screenshots. The goal of this project is to equip players (especially youth and students) with practical skills to identify and challenge false or manipulative content online.

This project is part of a digital literacy initiative aimed at making critical thinking fun, immersive, and accessible.

**What You'll Learn**

- The difference between misinformation, malinformation, and disinformation

- How to use tools like reverse image search, fact-checking sites, and lateral reading

- How emotional manipulation plays into fake content

- Why credibility, trust, and urgency affect how we perceive truth online

**How It Works**

1. Navigate a series of real-world inspired situations (group chats, comment threads, fake news headlines)

2. Choose how to react: fact-check, ignore, share, or investigate

3. Each decision affects your Trust, Credibility, and Time stats

4. At the end, you get a summary report of your performance and what you learned
